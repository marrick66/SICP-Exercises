;Exercise 3.44.  Consider the problem of transferring an amount from one account to another. Ben Bitdiddle claims that this can be accomplished with the following procedure, even if there are multiple people concurrently transferring money among multiple accounts, using any account mechanism that serializes deposit and withdrawal transactions, for example, the version of make-account in the text above.

(define (transfer from-account to-account amount)
  ((from-account 'withdraw) amount)
  ((to-account 'deposit) amount))

;Louis Reasoner claims that there is a problem here, and that we need to use a more sophisticated method, such as the one required for dealing with the exchange problem. Is Louis right? If not, what is the essential difference between the transfer problem and the exchange problem? (You should assume that the balance in from-account is at least amount.)


;This is essentially a two part transaction, withdrawing and depositing.  While each of these procedures are serialized seperately, it's possible that either account's balance could be changed between the withdrawal and deposit. For instance, if we want to withdraw from account A to account B:

;Initial balances: A = $100, B = $50

;Process 1 withdraws $50 from A and deposits it into B
;Process 2 withdraws $75 from B and deposits it into A

;There could be interlacing where process 1 has withdrawn the $50 from A but has not deposited it yet. Process B tries to withdraw $75 during this time. Since B only has $50, the transaction rejects.  Then process A deposits into B.
